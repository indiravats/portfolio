The theme of our session was to discuss the Recent Trends and Future Research Perspectives in Computational Artificial Intelligence. I presented a paper titled "A review on Artificial Intelligence Based Sign Language Recognition Techniques". 

Over the last few decades, significant efforts have been made in the field of web accessibility. Successful tools were developed leveraging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Speech Recognition systems and motion detection using Computer Vision. Despite being popular amongst people who are unable to speak or hear, there exists a great disparity in the knowledge of Sign Language in the general population consisting of able-bodied individuals. This necessitates the existence of a system that bridges this gap, and allows for efficient interpretation of Sign Language.

The objective of this review was to analyze the latest tools and advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence for Sign Language Detection. The paper draws comparisons and states the outcomes of the work being done on Sign Language Recognition systems so far. It outlines the methodology used in the steps of Data Acquisition, Feature Extraction and Model Training. It also discusses different methodologies, components, functions and drawbacks of an SLR system. 

Apart from presenting, attending this conference was an equally academically enriching experience. I got to learn a lot from the rest of the speakers and their insightful talks.
