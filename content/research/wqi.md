### Description
**Guide:** **Dr. Kakoli Banerjee** (Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, JSSATEN)

*Submitted to MDPI Water for review* 

A Research Project which estimates and analyses the Water Quality Index in Uttar Pradesh, India. It finds a subset of other known physiochemical water quality parameters affecting WQI the most from a collected dataset for its prediction using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms.

This project received a grant of INR 300,000 from the Collaborative Research and Innovation Program. 

(1) Dataset of 51 collected groundwater samples from Gautam Buddha Nagar

(2) Computes WQI for groundwater samples using the Brown et al. method 

(3) Employs Supervised Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor) for the prediction of WQI

(4) Reduces the dimensionality of computation of WQI to a single variable i.e. Turbidity
