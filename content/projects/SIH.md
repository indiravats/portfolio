## Description

[![Accessible Platform for Entrepreneurs](/projects/accessibility-system/video.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmOgL6IYQkM)

I lead this project with my team for Smart India Hackathon, and I'm further pursuing a part of it as my Final Year Project. 

In order to build a comprehensive accessibility toolkit, I carried out an extensive literature study on the topic to conclude that there only exist softwares which target one problem to help and make web and computer applications more accessible but there is a need for a mechanism that meets the needs of a vast category of people. 

Key features and roles:

(1) Manually collected dataset using OpenCV and Mediapipe

(2) Uses LSTM Neural Network to recognize ASL alphabets for fingerspelling 

(3) Implements a software based Braille Keyboard by manipulating keyboard event listeners
